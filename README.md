## How it works

This app is powered by:

üöÄ [Replicate](https://replicate.com/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=changehairstyleai), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.

‚úÇ [HairCLIP](https://replicate.com/wty-ustc/hairclip?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=changehairstyleai), an open-source machine learning model that generates images of hairstyles by text and a reference image.

‚ñ≤ [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform for running web apps.

‚ö°Ô∏è Nuxt.js [server-side API handlers](server/api), for talking to the Replicate API.

üì¶ [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), a Vue.js component framework for the browser UI.

## Run it yourself

You need a [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=changehairstyleai) (and optionally an [Upload.io public API key](https://upload.io/dashboard/security/api_keys)). Copy the contents of [.example.env](.example.env) into a new file in the root of your directory called `.env` and insert the API key(s) there, like this:

```bash
# Get your Replicate API token at https://www.replicate.com/account
NUXT_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<put your token here>

# Optional, if you're planning to use Upload.io.
NUXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_API_KEY=<put your key here>
```

Then, install the dependencies and run the local development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. Done!
